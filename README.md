ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew Sanchez.  An Economics graduate of the class of 2013 from California State University Long Beach.  I entered the freight industry shortly after graduating and after my tenure of 8 years I am ready for a career change.
Data analysis employs the type of problem solving and analytic thinking that I have preferred to perform while at work.
Getting to the root of the problem and enacting improved procedures are passions of mine.


ðŸ§  Iâ€™m interested in expanding my R coding and SQL skillset.  I have some experience with both tools but would like to master them.
I have used Excel and Google sheets quite often in my freight career and would consider myself well versed.
I am also working my way to learning how to code with Python.

ðŸ‘” I am relatively open about what industry I would like to enter for my first data analyst role.  
My top three areas of interest include, The Environment, Transportation, and Music/Entertainment.

ðŸŽ¸ In my free time I love to play guitar and write music.  I have been playing guitar since I was 9 years old and also play the drums, synthesizer/piano, and bass.

- ðŸ“« I can be best reached via email: matchesmusick@gmail.com

Thanks for checking out my profile!
